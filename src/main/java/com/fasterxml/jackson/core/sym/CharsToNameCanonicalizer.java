/**
 * This class is a kind of specialized type-safe Map, from char array to
 * String value. Specialization means that in addition to type-safety
 * and specific access patterns (key char array, Value optionally interned
 * String; values added on access if necessary), and that instances are
 * meant to be used concurrently, but by using well-defined mechanisms
 * to obtain such concurrently usable instances. Main use for the class
 * is to store symbol table information for things like compilers and
 * parsers; especially when number of symbols (keywords) is limited.
 *<p>
 * For optimal performance, usage pattern should be one where matches
 * should be very common (especially after "warm-up"), and as with most hash-based
 * maps/sets, that hash codes are uniformly distributed. Also, collisions
 * are slightly more expensive than with HashMap or HashSet, since hash codes
 * are not used in resolving collisions; that is, equals() comparison is
 * done with all symbols in same bucket index.<br />
 * Finally, rehashing is also more expensive, as hash codes are not
 * stored; rehashing requires all entries' hash codes to be recalculated.
 * Reason for not storing hash codes is reduced memory usage, hoping
 * for better memory locality.
 *<p>
 * Usual usage pattern is to create a single "master" instance, and either
 * use that instance in sequential fashion, or to create derived "child"
 * instances, which after use, are asked to return possible symbol additions
 * to master instance. In either case benefit is that symbol table gets
 * initialized so that further uses are more efficient, as eventually all
 * symbols needed will already be in symbol table. At that point no more
 * Symbol String allocations are needed, nor changes to symbol table itself.
 *<p>
 * Note that while individual SymbolTable instances are NOT thread-safe
 * (much like generic collection classes), concurrently used "child"
 * instances can be freely used without synchronization. However, using
 * master table concurrently with child instances can only be done if
 * access to master instance is read-only (i.e. no modifications done).
