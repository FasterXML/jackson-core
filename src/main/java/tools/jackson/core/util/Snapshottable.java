/**
 * Interface that defines one method (see {@link #snapshot}) for ensuring that we get
 * an instance that does not allow modifying state of `this` instance. Instance returned
 * may be `this` if (and only if) it is immutable through its API (or, for some limited
 * circumstances, if usage is guaranteed not to modify it after this point -- such usage
 * is discouraged however); or, if that can not be guaranteed, a newly created copy
 * with same configuration and state as `this`.
 *<p>
 * Interface is intended to be used for persisting state for serialization, or to support
 * "re-build" of otherwise immutable objects like factories. Some of the helper objects
 * factories use and rely on have mutable state which can not be shared: instead, to support
 * re-building, a state object may be created to contain copies (snapshots).
 * Intent, therefore, is that caller does not need to know about immutability (or lack thereof)
 * of an entity but can simply call {@link #snapshot}.
