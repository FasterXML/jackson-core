2.3.0 (13-Nov-2013)

#8: Add methods in `JsonParser`/`JsonGenerator` for reading/writing Object Ids
#47: Support YAML-style comments with `JsonParser.Feature.ALLOW_YAML_COMMENTS`

  that input does not contain duplicate filed names
#77: Improve error reporting for unrecognized tokens
 (requested by cowwoc@github)
#85: Add `JsonGenerator.Feature.WRITE_BIGDECIMAL_AS_PLAIN`
#91: Add methods in `JsonGenerator` for writing native Type Ids
#92: Add methods in `JsonParser` for reading native Type Ids
#93: Add `getFeatureMask()`, `setFeatureMask()` in `JsonGenerator`/`JsonParser`
#94: Allow coercion of String value "null" (similar to handling of null token)
#96: Add `JsonFactory.requiresPropertyOrdering()` introspection method
#97: JsonGenerator's `JsonWriteContext` not maintained properly, loses
  current field name
 (reported by Sam R)
#98: Improve handling of failures for `BigDecimal`, for "NaN" (and infinity)
#102: Unquoted field names can not start with a digit
#103: Add `JsonFactory.canHandleBinaryNatively`, `JsonGenerator.canWriteBinaryNatively`
 to let databind module detect level of support for binary data.
#105: Parser parsers numbers eagerly; does not report error with missing space
#106: Add `JsonGenerator.Feature.STRICT_DUPLICATE_DETECTION` for preventing dup names
#110: Improve overridability of `JsonGeneratorDelegate`
 (suggested by qpliu@github)
#111: _currInputRowStart isn't initialized in UTF8StreamJsonParser() constructor
 (reported by dreamershl@github)
#115: JsonGenerator writeRawValue problem with surrogate UTF-8 characters
 (reported by Marcin Z)
#116: WriterBasedJsonGenerator produces truncated Unicode escape sequences
 (reported by Steve L-S)
- Improve `DefaultPrettyPrinter`, `Lf2SpacesIndenter` (from databind #276)
- Add `JsonGenerator.canOmitFields()` method to support discovery of
  positional formats, needed for handling of filtering for CSV
- Rewrite `InternCache` to use `ConcurrentHashMap`, to work more efficiently both
  for common case of few misses (no block on access), and slowest cases (lots of
  misses).
- Add `JsonPointer` implementation, to be used by tree model, streaming
- Make `UTF8StreamJsonParser` non-final, for potential sub-classing

2.2.3 (23-Aug-2013)

#78: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException for very long numbers (>500 digits)
 (reported by boothen@github)

Fixes:

#51: JsonLocation had non-serializable field, mark as transient

Improvements

#46, #49: Improve VersionUtil to generate PackageVersion, instead of

 level of traversal over any and all Tree Model implementations
#69: Add support for writing `short` values in JsonGenerator

  message without location info

  for 'createJsonParser'/'createJsonGenerator') in 'JsonFactory'
* Try to improve locking aspects of symbol tables, by reducing scope of
  synchronized sections when creating, merging table contents.
* Added 'JsonFactory.copy()' method to support databinding's 'ObjectMapper.copy()'
* Added method 'requiresCustomCodec()' for JsonFactory and JsonParser
* Added 'JsonParser.getValueAsString()' method (to support flexible conversions)
* Added META-INF/services/com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory SPI to register
  `JsonFactory` for even more automatic format discovery in future.
