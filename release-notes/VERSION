Project: jackson-core

Contains core streaming reader (`JsonParser`) and writer (`JsonGenerator`) abstractions,
factory for constructing readers/writers (JsonFactory), as well as a minimal set
of interfaces needed for streaming level to make callbacks and call-throughs,
via `ObjectCodec` and `TreeNode`.

Also includes implementation of this API for JSON.
Forms the base for other data formats as well, despite naming that suggests
JSON-specificity: naming is due to history, as Jackson started out as pure
JSON library.
